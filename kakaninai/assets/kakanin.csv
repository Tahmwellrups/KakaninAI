2. After washing the diket, it will be set aside and soaked with warm water or lamawan iti napudot nga danum, this is to ensure that the glutinous rice will be cooked evenly.
3. The process will then continue in grating the coconut using a wooden stool with a metal grater. The process is called panaggadgad ti niyog. Old coconut, which has a dark brown colored shell is used to make gata or coconut. The reason is that the older the coconut, the thicker its flesh becomes and its milk has a thicker and creamier texture which is perfect in cooking nilatikan.
4. After grating the coconut add 3 cups of water onto the coconut shaving and then squeezed it by hand or with a cloth. It will be strained to ensure that there are no solid particles or coconut shaving added into the coconut milk. There are two types of coconut milk which they call umuna nga pespes which is usually the first press that has a thicker and creamier consistency and maykadwa nga pespes or the second press which has a thinner texture.

8. The banana leaf plays an important part in the cooking process. Before pouring the mixture into the damilian, it will be covered with a banana leaf. Using a young banana leaf, it will be heated into the flame or what they call idalangdang ti apoy. This process softens the banana leaf making it easier to bend as they carefully lay it into the damilian. It is also important that the leaf does not have any hole, it will enable the latik to be slowly cooked and rise onto the rice cake.
9. Slowly pour the mixture to the damilian. 
10. Evenly spread the glutinous rice into the damilian this is done to ensure that it will be properly cooked. Another damilian, pre-heated with coal, is placed on top of the mixture.

Kapampangans learned how to make tamales, or boboto, from the Mexicans. Boboto means ""to vote"". This dish was inspired by women who were left at home while the men went to vote, according to some Kapampangan trivia. Together, they would create this kakanin.

During Spanish colonization, the Kapampangans are thought to have learned it from Mexicans. One of the numerous outcomes of the galleon trade between Manila and Acapulco.
Despite having the same name, they taste completely different, even though ""bobotu"" is another name for it in Kapampangan. Rice dough, or galapong, was used in place of masa de maiz, or corn dough. We had a plentiful supply of banana leaves, so they took the place of corn husks as wrappers.","The yellow-orange top and the white bottom are the two components of Kapampangan tamales.  The main ingredients of both are rice dough (galapong), which is sautéed with onion and garlic before being simmered with coconut milk to create a thick paste. First, they are made independently using various ingredients.

The achuete oil that was added is what gives the top portion its yellow-orange hue. For added taste, ground peanuts are also added. After that, they are layered together and garnished with boiled chicken shreds, salted egg, ham, and nuts. Finally, they will be boiled or steam-cooked after being wrapped in multiple banana leaf sheets.",,,,,,,,,,,,"assets/kakanin_images/boboto.jpg"

Locals call this rice cake ""suman sa lihiya"" (rice cake with lye).

Even though Ibaan has no proprietary rights to the tamales, you must state ""tamales-Ibaan"" if you prefer this at the Lipa City public market. Naturally, Ibaan is less than 15 kilometers away from Lipa as the crow flies, and the town name is only included to show where the tamales were prepared.

Although tamales are also rice cakes wrapped in banana leaves in other parts of Batangas, the similarities stop there. ","Ibaan, Batangas, may not be a popular tourist destination, but it is home to a unique culinary treasure that only residents of Ibaan or those living on the outskirts of the city are aware of: Ibaan tamales. 

Ibaan tamales are spicy and nutty. You get a tasty combination of salted egg slices, peanuts, and chicken strips when you cut through the white outer layer. Atchuete or annatto seeds give the inner layer its orange coloring.

","Base: 2 cups rice flour, 2 cups coconut milk, 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp annatto oil, 1 tsp sugar
Filling: Shredded chicken/pork, boiled egg slices, crushed peanuts, optional chorizo/salted egg
Wrapper: Banana leaves","1. Base: Cook rice flour, coconut milk, salt, and sugar over medium heat until thick. Add annatto oil for color.
2. Prepare Leaves: Cut banana leaves into squares and soften over a flame or steam.
3. Assemble: Spread the base on a banana leaf, add filling, and fold into a packet.
4. Steam: Steam tamales for 30–40 minutes.
5. Serve: Enjoy warm.
","Rhemar's Eatery is one store that asserts it is the original.","Transmitted as a part of the Ibaan people's familial customs.","Local versions of the tamales — which is by no means made only in Batangas — appear to be adaptations of the Mexican tamale. Although History books all say that the Philippine Islands were under Spanish colonial rule for more than three centuries, in fact much of the governance was conducted through Mexico, another of its former colonies. Hence, Mexican influence on Philippine culture is evident not just in local cuisine but also in other aspects of culture such as religion, language and the arts.

But to get back to the Mexican tamale, it is, in fact, an ancient delicacy that predates even Spanish colonial rule in Mexico all the way back to the time of the Aztecs. Traditionally, the Mexican tamale was a tortilla made by “cooking the [corn] kernels with lime, then grinding the dough on a stone slab.”

That the Filipino tamales uses dough made from rice instead of corn and banana leaves as wrappings instead of corn husks is probably due merely to a matter of historical practicality. Corn was not introduced in the Philippines until the late 1560s and widespread cultivation would not come until much later.

In contrast, both rice and bananas would have been readily available everywhere in the country early during the Spanish colonial regime and would have been obvious substitutes for corn and its husk when some enterprising cook decided to make a local adaptation of the Mexican tamale.

Meanwhile, the other rice cake people call the tamales in Lipa has no similarity to the Mexican tamale at all. As mentioned, it is called in other places as the “suman sa lihiya” (lye being “lejia” in Spanish).","This rice cake gets its sticky or gooey texture from lye water, which in the old days was made with ashes extracted from, among other things, the uray weed or spiny amaranth. It has no filling and, in fact, to enhance its flavor, coconut jelly is applied to its top side before it is eaten.

The smooth, white exterior of the tamales, which are wrapped in banana leaves and frequently knotted with a fine white string or straw, is the result of steaming pounded, gelatinous rice; the delicate covering serves as a ploy to conceal the depth of flavors that lie beneath. It is soft enough to cut in half, exposing a pale orange paste with tiny pieces of seasoned chicken mixed in. The tamales deceive you with their seemingly unremarkable appearance because every bite and forkful exposes a rich peanut paste flavor with a hint of spice. This little packet of food has a filling component from the chicken bits.",,,,,,,,,,,"The tamales had long been a staple of the May Navarro's family merienda during their younger years. It was a familiar part of summer vacations in Ibaan, enjoyed alongside suman (rice cake) and butchi. Its presence was as constant as a relative always seen at family gatherings. The family often brought tamales back to Manila to be frozen and steamed later, satisfying sudden cravings, despite knowing it would always be available upon their return to Ibaan. This habit of hoarding stemmed from the fact that this particular type of tamales wasn’t sold anywhere else in the country. While the writer had heard of other varieties of tamales from different parts of Batangas and other provinces, they hadn’t tried them—making the Ibaan version their undeniable favorite.","assets/kakanin_images/batangas_tamales.jpg"

Ang kakanin ay hinango sa dalawang salitang tagalog: ""Kain"" o kumain at ""Kanin"" o kanin. Ito ay ang termino ng mga pagkain na gawa sa malagkit na bigas at gata ng niyog.

May mga putong maliliit at may putong malalaki, depende kung paano ito ginawa. Pero iisa ang karaniwan sa puto, na silang lahat ay ginawa mula sa giniling na bigas.

Ang salitang puto ay galing sa salitang Malay puttu na ang kahulugan ay ibinahagi o hinati-hati. Ang puto ay ang pinasingawan gamit ang lansungan mula sa pinaasim na galapong (o fermented galapong).

Ang puto Biñan ang isa sa pinakamasarap sa mga puto. Ang mga sangkap nito ay hindi nagbago sa loob ng hindi bababa sa animnapung taon (60 years). Ang puto Biñan ay binubuo ng giniling na bigas, asukal, itlog, tubig, mantikilya, binudburan ng keso, kinayod na niyog at kung minsan ay may toppings na itlog na pula. Ang puto ay kalimitang inihahanda kasama ng masarap na pagkain tulad ng dinuguan o pansit.

Ang Suman ay niluluto rin sa ibang mga lugar subalit iba ang proseso, sangkap, at pambalot nito.","Ang suman ay isang kakanin na gawa sa bigas na niluluto sa iba't-ibang parte ng bansa, subalit iba't-iba rin ang proseso, balot, at lasa nito depende sa paraan ng pagluluto. Sa bayan ng Infanta, ang kilalang klase ng suman ay Suman sa Gata na sinasabing may kakaibang lasa at linamnam at masarap i-pares sa mainit na tsokolate. Ito ay kilalang-kilala na din sa buong lalawigan dahil lagi itong top seller sa ginaganap na Niyogyugan Festival tuwing pagdiriwang ng Araw ni dating Pangulo Manuel Quezon.

Ayon sa Punong Baranggay ng Brgy. Balobo na si Melchor Rodriguez, noong 1910 ang kaunahang magsusuman sa kanilang barangay ay si Tomasa Serafines. Nagsimula na noon ang unang proseso ng pagluluto ng suman. Sa panahong iyon ay sa kaldero pa niluluto ang suman, ang haba ng suman ay 12cm pa at nagkakahalaga ng PO.25 sentimo ang isang piraso. Ang ginagamit sa pagluluto ng suman ay malagkit na sariling ani na bigas ng mga mga taga Brgy. Balobo dahil dito ay may palayan na malagkit lamang ang itinatanim.

Ang suman sa Balobo ay sinasabing siyang hinahanap ng karamihan sa ICC (Infanta Commercial Center) sa kadahilanang ito ay nagtataglay ng natatanging lasa at linamnam. Ang mga sangkap nito ay malagkit o Glutinous rice na hinuhugasan ng maraming beses upang lalong lumabas ang natatanging lasa nito. Ang gata, asukal, at kaunting asin ay pinaghahalo halo at sinasala sa malinis na tela. Ang timpladong gata na nasa talyasi ay isinasaklang sa may tamang lakas ng apoy habang hinahalo. Pagkulo ng timpladong gata ay isasama na ang hugas ng malagkit at hahalu-haluin upang hindi magtutong, at ang apoy ay nasa alalay na lamang na ningas. Pagkaluto ng kusisap ay aahunin at palalamigin bago balutin sa nilaib na dahon ng saging. May mga pagkakataong nilalagyan din ng mantika ang kusisap upang maging mas makintab ang suman. Babalutin ito sa nilaib na dahon ng saging at ilalagay sa pasingawan, ang tubig ay kalahati lamang upang hindi maabot at mabasa ang suman. Dinadagdagan din ang tubig o tinutuyungan upang hindi maiga ang pagpapasingaw sa suman at maluto ng husto upang hidi kaagad mapanis at tumagal ito.","Malagkit na bigas

16. Ihanda ang mga dahon ng saging na siyang pagbabalutan ng kinusisap na malagkit. 17. Balutin ang kusisap sa tamang sukat at laki nito habang mainit.
18. Pagkabalot sa kusisap ay ihanay ito ng patayo at pahiga sa isang ""steamer"" ang mga binalot
na suman.
19. Matapos balutin at ihanay ang mga binalot na suman at isaklang ito para pasingawan. 20. Makalipas ang itinakdang oras, hanguin ito sa isang sisidlan at palamigin.
21. Kapag tapos nang palamigin ang mga suman, ay maaari na itong balutin o, isilid sa sisidlan na dyaryo o manila paper.","Ang pamamaraan ng pagluluto ng suman ay naipasa at natutunan ng mga gumagawa/nagluluto nito ngayon sa pamamagitan ng pag tulong sa pagbabalot ng suman ng mga kabataan noong (1940-1950) panahon ni Lola Mersabel Calleja, kilala sa tawag na ""Nana Ling-ling"", isa sa nakagisnang magluluto ng suman sa Barangay Balobo. Ang mga kabataan noon at hanggang ngayon ay tinuturuan magbalot ng suman hanggang sa matutunan na din nila ang pamamaraan nag pagluluto ng suman.","Dahil sa ang paggawa ng suman ay talaga namang napakaliwag at kinakailangan itong pag tulungan ng maraming tao. May mga kabataan ang sinasanay at natuto na magluto ng suman. May taga halo ng kusisap, may taga pag laib at taga punas ng dahon ng saging na ginagamit pang balot sa suman. Dahil dito, sa kasalukuyan ay ang mga marunong magluto nito ang pinakabata ay edad 12 at ang alam na pinakamatanda ay nasa edad 80 taong gulang. Mapa-babae o lalake din ay marunong magluto nito, lalo na sa mga nabanggit na barangay sa itaas.",,"Ang Suman sa Gata ay malinamnam at masarap dahil lalo sa gata ng niyog.

Ito rin ay karaniwang iniaalay din ng mga magsusumang Kristyano Katoliko tuwing may misa tanda ng kanilang pasasalamat sa patuloy na pag unlad ng pagsusuman.","Ang Suman sa Gata ay mahaba ang proseso at masusing niluluto na nangangailangan ng saktong mga sukat upang mapanatili ang lasa sa lahat ng final product. Sa katunayan, sa dami ng kailangan gawin para sa pagluluto ng suman, umaabot ito ng 8 oras na pagluluto. Ang paglalaib ay ginagawa rin upang i-disinfect ang dahon ng saging at upang malando ito.","Nagbigay daan sa mga taga Infanta upang magkaroon ng magandang hanap buhay ang pagluluto ng Suman sa Gata at nakatulong makapagpatapos sa mga a ng mga kilalang magsusuman. Sa tuwing buwan ng Agosto ay talaga namang lumalaki ang produksyon ng suman dahil sa pagdiriwang ng Niyogyugan Festival sa lalawigan ng Quezon.

Noong 1970's ay nagkakahalaga lamang ng P0.25 sentimo ang isang piraso nito at sa kasalukuyan naman ay nagkakahalaga ito ng P4.00 kada piraso o P100.00 isang bundle. Dahil sa patuloy na pagtangkilik sa produktong ito, patuloy ang pag unlad ng paggawa ng suman at nagkaroon na rin ng samahan ang mga magsusuman na tinatawag na ISMAI (Infanta Suman Makers Association Inc.).","Dahil sa sarap ng suman na gawa dito, nakagawiang pang pasalubong na din ito sa mga kilalang pulitiko at kilalang tao. Noong una rin, kung panahon ng eleksyon, isa ang suman sa mga pinapakain sa mga bisita o ibinibigay ng kandidato sa mga tao. Sa katunaya",,"Bagama't patuloy na umuunlad at naipapasa ang kaalaman tungkol sa paggawa ng suman ay patuloy din tumataas ang presyo ng mga sangkap sa paggawa ng Suman sa Gata.","Isa sa mga threats sa pagluluto ng Suman sa Gata ay mga natural na kalamidad dahil dito nasisira ang dahon ng saging na ginagamit na pambalot ng suman, gayundin, maraming magni-niyog ay agad na binebenta ang mga buko kaya't kumukonti na ang gangong niyog, nagiging isa rin sa problema ay ang malagkit na galing ibang lugar sapagkat may mga panahong walang makunan ng mgandang klase ng malagkit para sa kanilang pagluluto ng suman sa gata ay hindi ganoon kagandahan ang kinalalabasan ng nilutong suman kung minsan.","Ang Suman sa Gata ay patuloy na tinatangkilik hindi lamang ng mga Infantahin kundi pati ng mga nasa ibang bayan at lalawigan. Dahil dito, patuloy na niluluto ito.","Ayon sa kwento, ang pagkakaroon ng malawak na palayan na taniman ng malagkit ang naghikayat sa mga taga roon na magluto ng suman sa gata na kanilang inihahanda sa iba't- (suman) sa hapagkainan ay magiging buo ang kanilang pagsasamahan, at dumidikit din ang ibang okasyon, lalo na tuwing Bagong Taon.

Ayon kay Lourdes Mercado Quirrez, 69 taong gulang nakatira sa naturang Brgy., Si Lola Mersabel Calleja, kilala sa tawag na ""Nana Ling-ling"", ay nag-aakit sa kanila na magbalot suman noong kabataan niya.
Ayon sa mga impormante, ang suman ay karaniwang binibigay bilang palabit (souvenir/ token) sa mga bisita. Ito rin ay inihahanda sa mga kainan at espesyal na pagtitipon, at noong una daw ay hindi nawala sa handaan sa bagong taon.

Ang pagdidinagto ay lumang kaugalian na ng mga Infantahin, na sa paggamit ng halo't lusong ay makakagawa na ng Dinagto. Hango ang salitang Dinagto sa paraan ng paggawa nito, kilala sa tawag na pagdagto ng mga Infantahin na sa ibang bayan naman ay pagbayo. Ito ay ang mano-manong pagdikdik sa lusong gamit ang halo sa nilagang kamoteng kahoy o saging na saba at sa mga sangkap nito hanggang sa lahat ay magkakahalo na at maging Dinagto. Ang pagdagto ay tila may pag-intig ng lusong na para bang may nabubuong isang tunog at sa prosesong ito ay makakaranas din ng ngalay ang sino man gumagwa ngunit sa bandang huli ay masasabing sulit ang pagod sa paggdawa dahil sa sarap ng lasa nito.

Ngunit ayon kay Gng. Dela Paz sa paglipas ng panahon ay nawawala na ang tradisyunal na paggawa sa Dinagto dahil sa mga nagsulputan makabagong makina na nagpapabilis sa paggawa ng Dinagto. Sa ngayon ay madalas na siyang gawin o lutuin upang ibenta, karamihan ay hindi na gumagamit ng halo't lusong kaya naman mas mabilis silang nakakagawa ng Dinagto.

The barangays are facing Tagkawayan Bay. Brgy. Rizal is a fishing community while Brgy. Sabang is both a farming and fishing community. It is also found in Daet, Camarines Norte, and Teresa, Rizal where her immediate family members now reside and continues to make the sumang balinsuso.","According to the local dialect, ""balinsuso"" means ""like a cone"" or ""like a breast."" Suman Balinsuso is a sort of Filipino rice cake (suman) that is wrapped in banana leaves in a distinctive cone or ""breast-like"" shape. 

Usually made from glutinous rice boiled with sugar and coconut milk, this traditional treat has a rich, creamy, and sweet flavor. It's a distinctive take on the various types of suman that can be found in the Philippines, each distinguished by its shape, wrapping method, and local ingredients. 

","Processes Involved - Sumang balinsuso is made with either glutinous rice, cassava, taro (San
Fernando) or flour.","The first is buying and preparing of the available ingredients then it is followed by the
paglalaib ng dahon ng saging (gently putting and running the banana leaf over a fire). If the
sumang balinsuso is made from glutinous rice, cassava, and taro, it is soaked in water for at
least an hour to soften it for grating and grinding. If it is made from flour, it is directly mixed
with sugar and the coconut meat.

The banana leaf is then set aside to give way for the pagkakayod ng lukarin (scraping of
coconut for its meat). The coconut meat is then placed in an aluminum basin to rest.

Before mixing, the glutinous rice, cassava, or taro (San Fernando) are added first followed by
the coconut meat, sugar, and the optional vanilla extract or pandan leaf. It is immediately
kneaded to properly mix the ingredients and to produce a dough-like consistency.

The next step involves the process of preparing the banana leaf in what is called the
pagsususo ng dahon ng saging in a cone like shape. The mixed ingredients are then placed in
the cone shaped banana leaf using a spoon as measuring device. Usually, a cone shaped
banana leaf needs an approximate 2-3 spoonfuls (or depending on the desired size of the
balinsuso) of the mixed ingredients to completely fill. After this process, the top leaf part of
the cone is then sealed by the same banana leaf from the cone.

When the raw sumang balinsuso is ready, a siopao steamer is prepared, and it is stacked
with the sumang balinsuso with the long point facing the center of the steamer. It is then
placed on a firewood, and it is left to boil and steam for an hour. It is checked for at least
once or twice to see if it is cooked or if the water completely evaporated. This is done to
make sure that the sumang balinsuso will not be burnt or slightly be undercooked.
Once it is cooked, it is placed on a table or a bilao to cool down and to drain the excess
water before it is to be sold.

If the sumang balinsuso meat is white, it is made from flour or glutinous rice. If it is yellowish
to brownish, it is made from cassava and taro (San Fernando). The use of flour in the sumang
balinsuso is just a last resort when other ingredients are hard to find.","Setting - The house of Crisanta Cater.

and 3 grandchildren (Reynald C. Dusto-21 years old, Lerra C. Dusto-9 years old, Lorenze C.
Dusto-24 years old).","It is mainly learned through observation and by assisting other family members while making
the sumang balinsuso.","The Sumang Balinsuso is a 70-year-old culinary tradition practiced by the Sinson -
Cater Family in Sitio Cotmo of Barangay Rizal Tagkawayan, Quezon for 3 generations. It is
simply and fondly called 'Balinsuso' by the locals because it is wrapped in a shaped shell-like
banana leaf. This shell-like delicacy was brought from lloilo by Teresa Tino Sinson +, and
passed down to her eldest daughter Crisanta Sinson Cater, 70 yrs. old who has been
perfecting this craft since 1953 when she was just 15 years old.

She continued making the sumang balinsuso in Tagkawayan and the knowledge and skills in
making it now reached her siblings and children up to now.

Today, eight of her immediate family members are known sumang balinsuso makers.

Occasion/Season - No specific occasion or season but it is usually made in the morning and
in the afternoon just right for breakfast and merienda.","The look and the triangle shape of the sumang balinsuso is unique and at some
point, invites curiosity due to the way it is wrapped in the banana leaves.","With its roots from the pre-Hispanic era and one of the foods that are
considered to be authentic or originally made in the Philippines, the sumang balinsuso is still
considered as a comfort food beloved by many locals. It is still regarded as one of the best
pasalubong to be given to family members as well as a traditional merienda.","The making of the sumang balisuso in mainly practiced by the Sinson-
Cater family members and is enjoyed by the locals as breakfast or merienda perfect with a
cup of coffee.

It became the root that bonded the family together. Many of the family members
became known for their skills in making the sumang balinsuso and other kakanin. Locals are
patronizing the sumang balinsuso and other kakanin by the Sinson-Cater family and there
are times that even its taste is imprinted in the memory of those who have tasted it thus
becoming a generational affair.
",,,"It is the main source of income for the Sinson-Cater Family for more that
50 years. It uplifted the quality of living for the family. It also provided odd jobs to some
teens by selling the products in a bilao in the center of Tagkawayan.",,,"It is still being practiced and cooked by the family of Crisanta S. Cater and has now reached
Teresa, Rizal and Daet in Camarines Norte.","-Availability and price of the ingredients for making the sumang balinsuso.
-The sumang balinsuso is prone to spoilage, it must be consumed or sold within the
day.","It is continuously being practiced and shared within the family members of Crisanta Cater with 9-year-old Lerra Dusto (granddaughter of Crisanta) the latest to learn the culinary tradition.","Crisanta S. Cater learned the culinary tradition of making the sumang balinsuso from her
mother Teresa T. Sinson in lloilo in 1953 at the age of 15 years old. She left Iloilo when she
married a native of Ligao, Albay and there she continued making the sumang balinsuso until
the late 1970s.

In the 1970s, her family left Ligao, Albay when her husband died and when the troubles of
the insurgency during the Martial Law reached their land and they settled in Brgy. Rizal in
Tagkawayan, Quezon.

Upon settling in Sitio Cotmo in Brgy. Rizal, Tagkawayan, Quezon, they immediately
continued the culinary tradition of making the sumang balinsuso. Within a few years of
selling the sumang balinsuso and other kakanin in Brgy. Rizal, Brgy. Poblacion, and
specifically the public market of Tagkawayan, they became well-known for it and many locals
wait to buy from them.

It became the main source of income for the family of Crisanta, and it is greatly credited for
alleviating them from abject poverty. From acquiring lands, building a decent house, to
sending her children and grandchildren to school, the knowledge and skill in making sumang
balinsuso and other kakanin is simply a life saver.

Other family members who learned the culinary tradition of making the sumang balinsuso
and other kakanin are following in the same footsteps of Crisanta and it also saved them
from poverty.

Though Crisanta is almost considered as an expert in making the sumang balinsuso, she is
from time to time distracted by other things that eventually resulted in the burnt sumang
balinsuso or if the fire is not controlled properly. One batch of making the sumang balinsuso
has an approximate 100 pieces.

The leftover or those that are not bought nor sold sumang balinsuso are grilled for personal
consumption and became a favorite among her grandchildren. Balinsuso is always cooked
outside the house in a dirty kitchen because of the smoke and grime that the firewood
produces.

Not all banana leaf is created equal, there is one banana leaf that is forbidden or avoided to
be used in the process of making the sumang balinsuso. The leaf of the turdang puti is
seldom used for it gives a bitter taste to the sumang balinsuso once it is steamed.

The sumang balinsuso of Crisanta S. Cater has reached Antipolo, Batangas, and Sampaloc in
Metro Manila through orders as pasalubong.

Today, eight of her immediate family members, 1 sibling (Virginia S. Granata 67 years old),
children (Loreta C. Dusto-45 years old, Caressa C. Binsal-39 years old, Marites B. Halina-49
years old, Crisanto S. Cater-43 years old), and grandchildren (Reynald C. Dusto-21 years old,

Nagluluto si Nanay Angelina ng suman (traditional rice cake). Ang isang pagbisita sa kanyang tirahan ay nagpapakita na siya ay nakatira sa isang bahay kasama ang ilan sa kanyang mga apo. Gamit ang tradisonal na recipe, paraan at kasangkapan, niluluto niya ang suman sa isang malaking kawali na inilagay sa kalan na gawa sa bakal. Si Nanay Angelina ay nagtatrabaho, hindi sa isang espesyal na itinalagang kusina para sa kanyang kaselanan kundi sa parehong sala kung saan ang kanyang mga apo ay nanonood ng mga palabas sa isang maliit na telebisyon. Sa kanyang living room-cum suman preparation area, makikita ang mga dahon ng niyog at dahon ng saging ng plantain: parehong ginagamit sa pagbabalot ng suman, kasama ang mga sako na naglalaman ng ibat ibang uri ng palay ng Malagkit (glutinous rice), Señorita, at Sinongsong rice varieties. Sa parehong lokasyon, may nakalatas na mga string mula sa napunit na putt at asul na mga sak ng bigas. Sa pagpasok pa sa bahay, makikita ang kusina kung saan nakaupo ang isang malaking kalan na pinaputok ng uling na gawa sa luwad, ilang mga palanggana na naglalaman ng mga pinatuyong balat ng niyog para sa pagniningas ng apoy para sa kalan, at isang makina para sa paghiwa ng karne ng niyog na binili niya mula sa kanyang kinita mula sa pagbebenta. Kanyang rice cakes. Sa isa pang bahagi ng kanyang malit na bahay ay may isa pang silid na nahahati sa dalawang resting area na hinating isang malaking cabinet na gawa sa kahoy. Sa labas ng bahay ay isang hardin kung saan ang bonsai at iba pang ornamental na halaman ay umunlad; na ayon sa kanya ay binebenta rin. Nakatayo ang kanyang bahay sa isang malaking lote na pag-aari ng kanyang mga kamag-anak sa panig ng kanayang ina at nagbibigay-daan sa sapat na espasyo para sa maraming halaman at hayop sa bukid tulad ng mga manok at pato pati na rin ang mga alagang hayop tulad ng mga aso at puusa na gumala at lumaki. Ang 15-20 minutong paglalakad mula sa kanyang tahanan ay magdadala sa isa sa isang taniman ng saging kung saan nakukuha niya ang mga dahon ng saging na ginagamit niya sa pagbabalot ng suman sa lihiya (rice cakes sa lihiya) na kanyang ibinebenta bilang pangunahing kita ng kanyang pamilya.","Si Nanay Angelina ay tubong bayan ng Bansud, Oriental Mindoro. Natutunan niya ang pagluluto at paghahanda ng suman mula sa kanyang ina na nagturo sa kanya noong siya ay labindalawang taong gulang pa lamang. Gayunpaman, katorse anyos pa lang siya nang magsama sa kanyang kasintahan para bumuo ng pamilya. Bago siya naging labing-walo ay mayroon na siyang dalawang anak na babae. Noong 1971, nagpasya silang mag-asawa na lumipat sa sitio Proper II, barangay Bulusan, Calapan City. Hindi tradisyon kundi kahirapan ang nag-udyok sa kanya na magluto at magtinda ng suman para mabuhay sila lalo na't lumalaki na ang sarili niyang pamilya na may apat na anak. Nagamit ni Nanay Angelina ang mga kakayahan na nakuha niya sa sarili niyang ina para masuportahan ang pangangailangan ng kanyang pamilya. Hanggang sa kasalukuyan ay patuloy siyang naghahanda ng tradisyunal na rice cake/suman dahil nasusustento pa rin nito ang pangangailangan ng kanyang pamilya.
Ang mga pangunahing sangkap na ginamit para sa kanyang suman sa lihiya (rice cake in lye) ay kinabibilangan ng mga sumusunod: bigas na malagkit (glutinous rice ng Senorita at Sinongsong varieties), lihiya (lye/caustic soda/lye water) gata ng niyog at brown sugar. Ang dahon ng saging ng Plantain ay ginagamit para sa pagbabalot ng mga indibidwal na rice cake.",,"Proseso ng pagluluto: Una, painitin kaagad ang mga dahon ng saging malapit sa apoy upang maging mas malambot at flexible ang mga ito.

Ang mga pambalot ng dahon ng saging ay magbabago ng kulay mula sa berde hanggang sa bahagyang itim na berde habang nagpapahiwatig na ang suman ay luto na.
Upang maghanda ng coco jam na matamis na sarsa para sa suman, ang brown sugar ay caramelized sa isa pang yok. Kapag ang asukal ay na-caramelized, purong gata ng niyog ang ibubuhos dito. Ang gata ng niyog ay ginawa sa pamamagitan ng pagpindot sa ginutay-gutay na mature na karne ng niyog. Ang patuloy na paghalo upang paghaluin ang caramelized na asukal at gata ng niyog ay magbubunga ng coco jam. Kapag lumamig ang coco jam, 2 tbsp, ng coco jam ang pumupuno sa isang plastic packet na sarado na may sealer. Ang isang pakete ng coco jam ay kasama ng isang pares ng suman. Minsan, mas pinipili ng mga customer na bumibili ng suman sa mga batch na ilagay ang kanilang coco jam sa loob ng mga garapon ng salamin.
Ibinahagi ni Nanay Angela na may panahon na tumataas ang benta ng suman, at ito ay sa mga buwan ng Nobyembre at Disyembre at gayundin sa mga gamu-gamo kung kailan mas maraming kasalan. Ang mga kasalan at karamihan sa mga pagdiriwang ng mga Pilipino ay nauugnay sa pagkonsumo ng suman. Bukod sa pagiging isang mahal na tradisyonal na pagkain sa Pilipinas, ang suman, na gawa sa malagkit na bigas, ay nagpapahiwatig ng pagkakaisa at lakas ng pagkakabuklod.
Ang suman sa lihiya ay pinakamahalaga sa panahon ng mga kasalan dahil ito ay nakabalot sa mga pares na nakatali. Sa kasalukuyan, bumagal ang produksyon ng suman, dahil sa pagbaba ng benta dahil sa pandemya, sabi ni Nanay Angelina.","Sa lahat ing magkakapatid sa kanyang pamilya sa Bansud, tanging si Nanay Angelina lamang ang patuloy na gumagawa at namimili ng suman.Mode of transmission (Describe how the knowleage and skills related to the element is passed on)

Sa Calapan City lamang, maraming pangalan ang naging tanyag sa mass producing suman sa lihiya (rice cake in lye)","Isinalaysay ni Nanay Angelina na ang kahirapan ang nagtulak sa kanya upang lubos na mapaunlad ang kanyang kakayahan sa paggawa ng suman upang mapakain ang kanyang lumalaking pamilya. Ipinagpatuloy ng kanyang mga apo ang kanilang pag-aaral sa tulong ng kanilang kinikita sa pagtitinda ng suman.","Ang mga natural na kalamidad tulad ng mga bagyo ay nagbabanta sa produksyon ng suman dahil ang malakas na hangin ay sumisira sa mga halaman ng saging at ang kanilang mga dahon ay hindi magagamit para sa pagbabalot ng suman sa lihiya (rice cake sa lihiya).",,"Sa mga kasalan sa maraming probinsya sa Pilipinas, laging nasa hapag ang suman sa lihiya. Ito ay nagsasaad ng pagkakaisa at kasaganaan kasama ang pangunahing sangkap nito, ang malagkit o malagkit na bigas na karaniwan sa iba't ibang Señorita at Sinongsong.

Poblacion District 1 at 2, ay ginagawa ang pagluluto nito kapag may mga katutubong okasyon.","Ang pagluluto ng linutlut na kilala rin sa tawag na lutlut at mundog ay nakaugalian na ng mga
Pala'wan sa tuwing may mga katutubong okasyon bilang pasasalamat sa kanilang Empu (Diyos).
Niluluto nila ito partikular tuwing may piyesta, bulun (kasal), umanat (pasasalamat) pagkatapos
ng ani ng kaingin, at sagda na ginagawa kapag may gumagaling na may sakit.
Sa paniniwalang Pala'wan, kinakailangang matupad nila ang tradisyong ito taon-taon upang

1. Bayuhin ang malagkit na bigas para matanggal ang palay nito at saka tatahipan sa bilao.
2. Ilagay ang nabayong bigas na malagkit sa loob ng sako, at saka ibabad sa umaagos na tubig

6. Pagkatapos magkudkod, buhusan ng tubig ng ayon sa gustong dami at saka pipigain para
makuha ang gata at sasalain.
7. Ilagay ang gata sa kawayan hanggang sa kalahati nito at ilagay ang bigas na malagkit.
8. Kapag nailagay na ang lahat ng malagkit sa kawayan, ilalagay na ito sa marahang apoy
nang hindi masunog o mahilaw.
9. Habang nakasalang ito sa apoy, kailangan itong ikut-ikutin upang maluto nang maayos at
hindi masunog. Kung maraming niluluto ay tumatagal ng humigit kumulang apat na oras.
10. Para malaman kung luto na ang bigas, tinutusok ito ng patpat na kahoy. Kung malambot
na ang loob, ibig sabihin luto na ito at pwedeng nang hanguin, ritwalan, hain at kainin.","Ang panglima ang mangunguna sa mga magluluto ng linutlut, habang ang puas ang

barangays of the town. They do pagtinaldis for a living by selling the item during market days. They
also come up with special preparations when orders are placed by customers.","Pagtaldis is passed on from elders to younger family members through demonstrations or on-the-job
training. Observation is also a manner of getting information on how it is done.",,"Tinaldis is another way of lending a different taste to glutinous rice which otherwise will be difficult
to eat if prepared all on its own. Being tinaldis, makes glutinous rice a delicacy that can now be
regarded with its own taste, touch and virtuousity.",,"Family or community gatherings become more genial when tinaldis is served for snacks. Some
occasions like birthday, Christmas and New Year celebrations become more special when tinaldis is
served for, as it is believed by older folks, it brings luck.",,,,,"Because tinaldis is a consumer's delight then it is of economic value, it has a patronage of its own.
Thus, tinaldis makers generate a gainful livelihood out of their enterprise. The continued preparation
of tinaldis is also an assurance for the rice and coconut farmers that their produce have a steady
market.","The practice is being done up to now.","Unstableprice of glutinous rice and ""kalamay"" are the challenges for the practitioners.","Barangay Cotmon, Camalig, Albay helps promote native cuisine like ""tinaldis"" and other kakanin

sugar or brown sugar can be substituted. The glutinous rice should be cooked using lesser volume of
water compared to the normal volume required for cooking regular rice so that the glutinous rice will
not come out very soft (marugi) when mixed with the other ingredients.

Tinaldisis a special preparation for the new year's day because, the elders so believe, that it is good to
start the new year with foods made of glutinous rice, for the rice's stickiness/adhesiveness would help
maintain the ""stickiness"" or unity of the family and good fortune will adhere with family members
through the year.

Tinaldis also serves as offering during ""pasagugurang"" or ""pasubang"" and in other such events. It is
also popular for birthdays, fiestas, and other family or community occasions.","assets/kakanin_images/biko.jpg"
56,"Puto Lanson",1.00,8.00,13.00,24.00,"Puto lanson making is popular in many barangays of Camalig, particularly in Tagaytay. Tagaytay is
surrounded with rice fields and hills and to the north the ever present beautiful Mayon Volcano.
This barangay has earned the monicker the ""Puto Capital"" of the town. It has seven (7) Puroks. The
cuisine including its process is familiar to many residents in neighboring barangays. But the mass
production and selling of the food item is principally credited to some families in Purok 4 of Tagaytay.","Puto Lanson making is a testament to the Filipino's love for food and for company at any time of the
day. The said cuisine belongs to the group of native foods in the Philippines called kakanin. All kinds
of kakanin have their own respective unique and peculiar name, each carries its history that is as rich
and deeply rooted in our culture.

There are so many variations to puto throughout the Philippines and one of the more prevalent kind
is puto lanson or simply puto. In some places, it is popularly known as putong puti. The word puto is
derived from the Malay word puttu, which literally means ""portioned."" The regional variants of the
steamed cake take their names from either their appearance or their most notable feature just like
puto lanson or putong puti in Bikol which comes from its primeval color - white (puti). The cuisine is
steamed rice cake that uses plain rice flour and not glutinous or sweet rice flour. In many years back,
the puto lanson was a popular part of merienda of the Filipinos.

According to the inhabitants of the barangay Tagaytay where puto lanson making is being practiced,
it started sometime in the 1930's. Residents believe that the very first person who was noted for
making puto lanson lived in Tagaytay, Camalig.","The following are the ingredients used by the puto lanson makers:
(The amount of each ingredients are only sample, you may add or lessen the quantity for bigger or
smaller servings.)
. 2 cups sugar
· 4 cups ground rice (if not available, regular/rice flour can be used)
. 2 cups milk/condensed milk in can
. Cheese (optional)
. Food coloring (optional)
· 1 egg
. 2 12 tbsp. baking powder (particular brand is Calumet)
. 2 1/2 cups of water","The following is the procedure in making puto lanson:
. Soak the rice. It can be done in aluminium basin.
. Rinse/wash the rice.
. Ground the rice in an electric mill.
. Whisk the ground rice, yeast, egg, baking powder and sugar together in a bowl. Add water and mix until well combined.
. Pour the mixture in molds or small cupcake pans. Fill the mixture in about two thirds full. They'll expand as they cook.
· (Optional) Cut the cheese into little squares then put them on top of the mixture.
. Prepare the steamer. Make sure you've put the necessary amount of water in the steamer and have set it to cook. Put the molds in the steamer and steamed for 20-30 minutes.
·Remove the puto from the molds. Give them a minute or two to cool down before you do this. When they're ready to handle, arrange them on a serving plate.","As of this time, the oldest living maker of puto lanson is Deogracias Nate Paloma. He is 90 yearsa

His wife is Salvacion Moron Paloma who passed away in 1993. They have nine (9) children with einh
(8) daughters and one (1) son. According to the key informant, Mr. Paloma, he learned making pe
lanson through observation. He used to observe the late Isabel ""Bing"" Miranda while the old wome
was making kakanin. He finally learned and begun to sell it at the age of 17 years old in 1945

Making puto lanson has been his livelihood and became his family's source of income. He alse
used to sell and haggle for the price of his homemade puto with retailers and vendors in othe
towns of Albay, particularly with those in the 3rd district of Albay. When there were occasions in the
community or in some households, people would order puto lanson as part of the food to be served

Another well-known puto lanson maker is Cristita Moron Miranda, 77 years old. She also resides in
Purok 4, Tagaytay. She learned puto lanson making from her mother, Remedios Moron Miranda who
died in 1945 at the age of over 80 years old. Today, the culture bearers in the community are still","This culinary tradition is being passed from generation to generation through informal means.
The skill is being taught to children by asking them to help in processing puto lanson. Present-day
practitioners, like Ms. Cristita Miranda leared from her late mother.

Now, Mr. Deogracias Nate Paloma have been orienting his children and grand children on how puto
lanson is prepared and even marketed. His son, Arnulfo Moron Paloma, learned much from the old
man and has also imparted his gained expertise to his wife, Juliet Loveres Paloma. Their family banks
on puto lanson for livelihood.","Kakanin has been a part of Philippine cuisine for as far back as history could record and memory
could recall. And, luckily the most basic and rudimentary composition, the cooking techniques, and
the taste are still linked with such humble victuals of today such as rice, glutina, coconut milk, and
meat which are still maintained and used even in these modern times.

The traditional way of cooking puto lanson is a clear manifestation of the resourcefulness of
Camalignungs, who take full advantage of all available resources including rocks, wood and flora.
The main ingredient of puto lanson is rice-the staple food of Filipinos. Though the oldstyle/method
of cooking of puto lanson consumed more time as it even involved fermentation and all natural
ingredients, compared with the present used techniques, the results were generally regarded as
healthier and natural.","Puto Lanson cooked the old fashion way gives it an elusive taste that shows the original flavor of
Bicol's own kakanin. The traditional puto lanson is pristine white, it is plump and fluffy and that
shows a uniqueness all its own. It is best served with banana leaf used as wrapper and that wrapper
adds to the puto its delicate scent. Puto lanson has a way with tickling the palate.",,"Making puto lanson draws a family together with recipes being passed along or down to other kins.
This cuisine always plays a part in any occasion and event in a typical Camalignung household. It's
been part of family bonding. Meriendas and snacks are much more complete with puto lanson. It is
sometimes eaten alongside savory viands, most notably the dinuguan and being marked as one of
the instinctive food as Filipino.
To recognize Barangay Tagaytay as the place where the cuisine is believed to have started and
developed, a Puto Lanson Festival was introduced in the community as part of its annual feast day.","Puto lanson is one of about eighty kinds of Filipino rice cakes. While puto lanson has slid into a
supporting role over time as part of a morning or afternoon meal, it goes to the heart of ancient
Filipino's spiritual beliefs and practices: ""Prehispanic g",,,,"Puto lanson holds a lot of promise as a primary economic commodity. It helps Camalignung families
develop another form of livelihood. The prospects of puto lanson of Camalig remains to be fully
revealed.","The culinary tradition is still popular in the town of Camalig. The tradition is still being actively passed
on to family members, associates, and friends. Over years, there are modifications in the methods
and ingredients to reduce time in the preparation and cooking. The outmoded equipment and tools
are not evident anymore among culture bearers and they used the modern stuffs at present. The
tradition has adopted new technologies and that insures its survival.","There is no immediate and serious threat for the culinary tradition to fade just easily. Making puto
lanson serves as a gainful source of livelihood for families devoted to the practice. The apprehension
that is being looked at is the possibility that grandchildren or the generations to come would get
away from the practice and prefer employment instead of developing the tradition that can optimize
its business potentials.","The tradition and the techniques in making puto lanson is being passed on from generation to
generation through non-formal education or by observation and on-the-job training.

One of the most effective safeguarding measures of the practice is through promotion of the culinary
specialty. It is already being served in restaurants and cafés and now known to the general public-
from other provinces and even from overseas. Another way to keep up interest in the tradition is
introducing new technologies and more modern equipment. Puto lanson makers are responding
to this aspect enthusiastically. Thus, there are puto lanson which has popular flavors like pandan,
cheese, ube, and others which cater to orders and demand of customers.

Puto Lanson Festival has also been introduced a couple of years back in barangay Tagaytay to prove
that puto lanson making is foremost and celebrated community undertaking.","It was in the early 1920's when puto lanson making started in the town of Camalig, particularly in
Barangay Tagaytay. The procedures, utensils, and ingredients used in the practice have changed over
the years.

In the past, to cook puto lanson only firewood of certain quality was used. This contributed to the
emergence of a distinct flavor to the puto lanson's traditional taste. The ingredients used then were
white sugar; rice, which was pounded in a mortar made of very hard (lâgit) rock; coconut milk; and
libadura (baking soda) or milled rice flour that served as yeast which took 3-4 hours to leaven the
mixture. With the use of these materials, puto lanson making took too much time but these classic
ingredients gave extra flavor that made it distinctive. This is now so different from the ingredients
used in present time, specially the use of rice flour instead of ground rice and the use of baking
powder (Calumet) which takes only ten (10) minutes for the mixture to expand or leaven.

Apart from the abovementioned changes in culinary tradition, there are also modifications in the
equipment or utensils used. The sarilo,commonly known as mouldings, for puto lanson used to be
made of lusa (local term). Before the lusa, they were made of glass. From lusa, aluminum material
was used; that measured 4.9 cm. in diameter (present - 5.5 cm in diameter). The steamer before
was square unlike now which is circular. This is because, people modify square cans of oil or biscuit
(Fig. 6) as their pots, so therefore need to use also steamer which is square in shape (Fig. 7). Early
producers of puto lanson didn't have electric milling machines, they used mortars made of lâgit rocks
(local term) to grind the rice, it is manual and took more time to finish.
In addition, the cost of puto lanson moved up from 7 to 8 centavoss per 60 pieces way back in
1960's to P100.00 - P120.00 in 2019 and P150.00 if special or with cheese for the same 60 pieces.
Residents of Camalig sometimes provide ingredients to puto makers and will just pay for labor of
making puto lanson. It used to be that labor cost seven (7) centavos for every 1 anyega (local term of
measurement in Bikol - 1 anyega is equal to 4 utsaba/cups); at present, puto lanson makers still use
the local term anyega as form of measurement when it comes to kakanin and 1 anyega costs P120.00

- P150.00 for labor.","assets/kakanin_images/puto_lanson.jpg"
57,"Ibos",2.00,8.00,13.00,24.00,"Ibos making is a popular tradition in the rural barangays of Camalig. Camalig is a first class municipality
located in the 2nd Congressional District of Albay province. Camalig is composed of 50 barangays of

Ibos making is one of the major industries in the town where coconut and glutinous rice, as the main ingredients, are abundant.","lbos is one of the traditional cuisines made from glutionous rice, salt, and coconut milk. It

In the households, younger
family members are required to help and observe how the elders prepare and cook the ""ibos.""","The ibos is an important part of Filipino culture widely patronized even in modern times. This culinary
treat has been passed on from ancestors of long ago to the present generation.","The way that the ibos is wrapped is unique by itself. It looks like origami at its most useful kind.",,,"Ibos is also served as an offering during some ritual rites like ""pasubang' and ""pasagu-gurang.""",,,,"Ibos making is a beneficial community economic activity. This can even be developed as an item for
tourism attraction.","Ibos making is in its healthy state in the municipality of Camalig.","There is no direct threat to the continued growth of ibos making in Camalig. However, price
fluctuations in the ingredients required remain as constraint. Fast food chains with their accessibility
and the popularity of their snack foods, such as hamburgers, fries, cakes, are serious challenges to
the growth of ibos as an industry.","Barangays Cotmon and Iluluan, Camalig are helping promote native delicacies like ibos and other
native cuisines during their Hoyop-Hoyopan Festival and Mais Festival, respectively.
The most serious challenge to the continued growth and public patronage to ibos is the proliferation
of fast foods outlets which sell commercially prepared food items which are catching public attention
rather phenomenally. If the production and promotion of ibos will not be given the needed attention
by concerned government agencies, private orgaizations, and general practitioners, residents might
one day wake up to find this gastronomical delight already a rarity, at the verge of extinction. Thus
the cultural mapping project of MTCHO under the LGU of Camalig in cooperation with NCCA is ofe
positive step towards the preservation and promotion of ibos making.","Camalignungs of all ages from all walks of life know what ibos is. It is as popular and familiar as the
peripatetic pan de sal. Ibos is a traditional cuisine used to be served during occasions. Today, there
need not be a birthday celebration or barangay fiesta for ibos to be available. Ibos makers now sell
their product in the public market almost on daily basis. Sometimes ibos peddlers make a round of
barangays.

Somehow, the ibos makers generate sales enough to provide for their daily needs and even support
the school needs of their children.

Local ibos makers have attained a high degree of proficiency in preparing and cooking this culinary
wonder so that about three barangays now claim to be the ""Ibos Capital"" of Camalig.

Ibos requires a minimum of ingredients, essentially glutinous rice, salt, coconut milk. The processing
of these ingredients is likewise simple. The difficulty, however, comes in the preparation of the
container/wrapper. Making the coconut leaf into leak/spill proof container is most taxing especially
for the inexperienced.

Ibos can be enjoyed as it is, direct from the wrapper (""karsotso"") but children relish it more when
eaten with sugar. Ibos goes very well with steaming coffee or hot chocolate for breakfast. For snacks,
softdrinks or juices would be a nice partner.

It used to be that when a family member would visit a relative who lives out of town, he'd bring along
ibos as ""pasalubong."" These days visitors would order ""ibos"" to be presented as ""pasalubong"" when
they go back home.","assets/kakanin_images/suman_sa_ibus.jpg"

on and passing to the next generation.

The cultural mapping being undertaken by the MTCHO under LGU Camalig in cooperation with
NCCA offers a positive move towards the preservation of balisongsong making as studies may result
in the adoption of measures which will be helpful at enabling native delicacies to compete with
commercially produced ones.","Balisongsong completes the list of native cakes and delicacies which are traditionally offered (""atang"")
during religious rites such as ""pagsagugurang"" and ""pasubang."" Although there is no written history
yet as to when balisongsong came to be, elders have it that it has been with the people of Albay for
as long as memory serves them. Balisongsong is popular not only in Camalig but in many places in
Albay, especially in areas which have abundant production of paddy. In Camalig though, balisongsong
makers are ever active, nary does a day passes without the item being available in the public market.

Balisongsong is made out of mechanically milled or mortar and pestle pounded glutinous rice mixed
with the ordinary variety. This then is mixed with scraped young coconut meat, coconut water,
and sugar. Grated (""iniraid"") cassava instead of glutinous and ordinary rice, is also very good for
balisongsong. In fact, some consumers find the cassava balisongsong more appetizing. The difference
between the two ingredients is that rice version is easier to prepare because it takes less time to
mechanically mill it; cassava is time consuming as it has to be grated (""iraid"") manually. Thus, it is
easier to find rice ""balisongsong."" 

When properly prepared and cooked, balisongsong exudes a unique flavor because of the ""agik-ik""
leaves used for wrapping. ""Agik-ik"" plants are still abundant in many places in Camalig. They grow
wild, in shady, forest-like environment. If ""agik-ik"" leaves are not readily available, banana leaves are
convenient substitutes.

Some Camalig balisongsong makers have been invited by government agencies to take part in trade
fairs to showcase their products and other native cuisines they are familiar with.","assets/kakanin_images/sayongsong.jpg"

adults, seems to have ideas on how it is done. This is attributable to the fact that linubak is not only
a well-liked gastronomic fare but that it is also something that groups of people want to do. Linubak
is not only for business purposes but it provides a very good reason for people to gather not for any
serious cause or occasion but simply to make and eat linubak. It used to be that the young men and
ladies of a barangay would get together on early moonlit nights and enjoy making and eating linubak.

Cassava and banana (saba or ""kalibo"" or ""turangkug"") are best for linubak. While moonlit nights no
longer entice young men and ladies to gather for linubak or neighborhood buddies to be together
to make and eat linubak, families have not lost the appetite for making and eating this delightful
foodstuff. And still, there are those who make linubak and sell what they produce","""Linubak"" is made out of bolied ripening banana (manibalang in Tagalog, ""ubal"" in Camalignon) or
cassava, which ever is available. The banana (saba or ""kalibo"" or ""turangkug"") are boiled unpeeled,
cassava is boiled peeled.The cooked banana is then unpeeled and placed, a little at a time, in a
mortar (""lusong"") to be ground by a pestle (""hâlo"") until mashed while the other ingredients are also
added as the pounding goes on, except for the fried peanuts which are earlier crushed. Now and
then, what are inside the mortar are mixed/blended using a big spoon or ladle.

The other ingredients traditionally used are: scraped young coconut meat (""lukaron""), fried peanuts,
evaporated milk, margarine, sugar (preferably brown).

When the banana with all the other ingredients are ground and the sweetness of the linubak
ascertained, it is ready to be served on pieces of banana leaf or plates, whichever is preferred. But
linubak which is for sale and peddled are usually wrapped in banana leaf.","Sugar (brown or refined)

5. When everthing is ground/mashed and properly mixed or blended, the sweetness is determined
according to desired taste, it is then ready to serve.","The culture bearers of pag-linubak are aged 15-65 years old. They can be found in any part of the
town. They do linubak for snacks or for livelihood or for the simple joy of doing it with friends and
family members or for the consumption of guests or others engaged in a community activity.","The practice is passed on through exposure. Linubak is a favorite of children, they mill around and
inquire a lot when the food is being prepared. Parents would sometimes ask the children to perform
a task related to linubak making. That way, they learn the process and are introduced to what
ingredients are used. They are introduced to the practice at an ealy age.","Linubak making is another proof of the versatility of mortar and pestle in the life of ordinary
Camalignungs since a long time ago. These do not only help in refining the abaca fibers whose utility
to the people cannot be gainsaid or turn palay into rice ready to be prepared for the table but these
also help them a lot in preparing other food items become more palatable and enjoyable, linubak
being one of them.","Linubak offers another practical way of presenting common food items such as cassava and banana
(saba/kalibo/turangkug) in a different light. The process of preparing this foodstuff makes it more
palatable for consumers of different ages.",,"Preparing linubak brings neighborhood pals closer to each other besides they learn the value of
performing a particular task to contribute to the accomplishment of something bigger such as peeling
cassava which will later be enjoyed as a sumptuous linubak.",,,,,"Residents who prepare linubak for family consumption not only saves money from buying food from
the stores or groceries but they also get assured of a nutritious meal. Those who prepare linubak for
sale are usually assured of an additional source of livelihood.","""Linubak"" making is still very popular in both rural and urban barangays in Camalig.","The production of quality mortars and pestles has become limited, in fact rare, they are no longer
easily available in public markets.","The cultural mapping project of MTCHO under the LGU Camalig in partnership with the NCCA is one
positive step towards identifying best practices in linubak making and conducting studies that can
further promote the practice.","""Linubak"" comes from the word ""lubak"" meaning to grind or to crush by pounding using a mortar
and a pestle. This is an ancient way of preparing certain food items into dough-like consistency. In
these modern days, blenders or grinders are now used to grind, to crush, to mash ingredients or even
entire food preparations. It is now easier to procure blenders or grinders than mortars and pestles
Nevertheless, those who prepare linubak still prefer the use of mortar and pestle because the results
are more palatable. While blenders or grinders can conveniently grind the ingredients into very fine
preparations, it is observed that something is taken away from the taste of the final product.
These days it is not easy to procure a mortar and pestle in public markets, one has to look for
somebody who makes these facilities and place an order. This is one reason, perhaps, why even
if a moonlit night is very alluring for friends to gather and make linubak they no longer do so. The
ingredients are available but not the mortar and the pestle.

Those who engage in linubak making for livelihood, go for mortar and pestle because that is more
cost effective. Besides, they do not have the capital to procure grinders and blenders. They are
likiewise wary of adding the cost of electricity to their production budget.

Between cassava and ripening banana, it easier to find the former and they are cheaper too.
Practitioners warn that cassava should be prepared and cooked properly as it has cyanogenic
glycoside which can turn into cyanide when consumed. That being understood, boiled cassava is also
rich in calories, carbohydrates, fiber, thiamin, phosphorous, calcium, and riboflavin.

Fried peanuts when added, gives a distinct taste to the linubak.","assets/kakanin_images/nilupak_na_saba.jpg"

66,"Tinumo nga Saging (Linupak)",9.00,9.00,16.00,27.00,"Tinumo' or 'linupak' is a culinary tradition in Numancia that entails pounding and mashing boiled unripe bananas (saba), and mixing it with sugar and grated/shredded coconut using 'eusong' (a large wooden mortar) and 'hae-o' (a large wooden pestle). The process makes a satisfying and appetizing native delicacy, which is customarily consumed by households as part of their breakfast or merienda (snacks). In addition, it is a constant food product sold for 10 pesos per piece by peddlers of home-made snacks in Numancia.

'Tinumo nga saging' is undeniably a favorite traditional food of Numanciahanons. However, the process of tinumo is also familiar among people in other towns of Aklan and other provinces, with some of them using 'balingka' (cassava) or kamote (sweet potato) as the main ingredient.","As a culinary tradition, the process of making 'tinumo nga saging' has been passed down by
the forefathers of Numancia to the younger generations. Usually served as snacks by
households, the youth learned it by observing how their parents and other adults made the
stomach-filling delicacy using a traditional mortar and pestle. Notably, the basic processes
involved in the preparation of tinumo are easy to remember, making its cultural transmission
and retention possible.

The efforts that go into the preparation of 'tinumo nga saging' are considered 'all-worth-it' by
many as justified by the taste and overall experience in consuming the snack. Though arm-
straining and lengthy, the processes and steps involved are, in actuality, plain and simple. First,
unripe bananas (saba) are boiled (a process locally known as 'ea-ga') for an hour or two,
depending on how many bananas are being cooked. Once cool, the boiled bananas are peeled
and placed in a 'eusong' (a relatively big wooden mortar), and are then pounded (ginabayo)
using a 'hae-o' (a relatively bigger and longer wooden pestle). Once slightly mashed, kaeamay
(sugar) and shredded coconut are added and the mixture is pounded again until mashed. This
process requires strength as the balanced taste of the tinumo depends on the continuous
pounding. Once mashed, the tinumo is ready for consumption. Peddlers shape it into a ball or
disk and sometimes wrap it in oiled banana leaves.",,,"As one of the most common and easiest-to-prepare delicacies in the municipality, tinumo nga saging is served by Numanciahanon families and households during breakfast and merienda. Female members usually prepare it for the whole family, but in some cases and due to the strength-requiring process, men help in the pounding of the ingredients. Children also learn at an early age and become capable in preparing the same.

Peddlers of the snack exist such as Remenita Andrade, known as 'Nang Mimi', a 56-year-old peddler of home-made snacks and lunch meals in the town hall. She has been peddling tinumo nga saging in Poblacion, Tabangka, and Joyao-Joyao for 20 years now. Her husband aids her in pounding the ingredients, which generally takes him an hour and 30 minutes to finish. Her usual 'suki' or customers are workers/staff in the Numancia Town Hall, Numancia Integrated School (NIS), and TRIGEN Bakery. During Sunday, she goes to the parish grounds and Poblacion's public plaza to sell her home-made goods.","The knowledge and skills in the preparation of the tinumo has been transmitted informally by generations of Numanciahanons as children and teenagers learned from their parents and
other immediate family members through observation and actual preparation. Since the processes involved are very basic and easy-to-remember, the culinary tradition continues to be a popular way of cooking unripe bananas (saba).",,"Consumed during breakfast and merienda, tinumo nga saging is a delectable native delicacy
of Numancia that is made from pounded boiled unripe bananas (saba), sugar, and shredded
coconut.",,"The processes involved in tinumo bring the family together by strengthening the family bonds
through collaborative efforts in preparing a favorite merienda. Although simple, the processes
require patience and work that could be enjoyable and satisfactory with the help of someone.","It is one of the snacks offered in the altars as an alternative to the glutinous rice or 'malagkit'
during the Celebration of All Saints Day.",,"Peddled for 5 to 10 pesos per piece, it has been one of the favorite snacks of school-children, students, and workers due to its affordability. Likewise, households and families prepare the home-made snack because of the low cost ingredients. Moreover, the socioeconomic significance of the 'tinumo nga saging' has been recognized by Barangays Poblacion, Joyao-
Joyao, and Badio by displaying the delicacy on their booths during the Annual Agri-Trade Fair.",,,"Continued practice by the locals.","The production of eusong is a dying local craft due to the presence of readily available mortar
and pestle in the market.","Pagtumo is actively transferred from one generation to the next through oral and non-formal
education.","In the old times, elders were known to give tinumo balls wrapped in 'ienahob nga dahon it saging' (banana leaves heated over fire) as their break-time snacks. They believed that the tinumo is a highly nutritious snack full of carbohydrates and therefore good for their highly
energetic young ones.

Nang Mimi relates that more than a year ago, she commissioned a local crafter in Kalibo to make a eusong and hae-o made of madre cacao, which she paid for 350 pesos. Other families have their eusong and hae-o made of indian mango tree, narra, balete, and even acacia.

Usually, Nang Mimi peddles tinumo nga saging for three days a week (35 pieces in a single day), and since the snack is a sought-after delicacy, it is always 'sold-out'. Numancia Town Hall is her first stop in the morning and some employees usually get excited upon knowing that she is selling tinumo for the day. Sometimes, all 35 pieces are bought by LGU personnel, leaving nothing for NIS teachers, who are likewise tinumo lovers. ","assets/kakanin_images/nilupak_na_saba.jpg"

leaves are used as the container. One must swirl the lukay over a mold to make individual
containers. The mixture of malagkit rice, coconut milk, sugar and salt are scooped to each
container. This needs to be locked properly by tying the end of the lukay to hold its form.

Sweetened shredded coconut (optional filling)
Yellow margarine (for topping)","Sinakol is quite laborious compared to other native delicacies like alupi and huwad huwad. The
grinding of the whole cassava root requires strength and energy to sustain until the end. Add to
that is the squeezing and pressing of the liquid from the grated cassava. If liquid is not
removed, it causes a taste of bitterness on the whole mixture affecting the produced delicacy.

A mixture of red sugar or washed sugar is added to the mixture before scooping an amount to
a holed tin can that serves as the molder (an emptied condensed milk can). The size of the tin
can is just right for the price a customer has to pay for each piece of cooked sinakol. Some
would fill it with cheese or sweetened shredded coconut for a better taste and texture and
topped with yellow margarine. It is better served while hot!","Rita I. Laurio is a 48 years old mother of five children. She inherits this love for
cooking from her grandmother Cristina A. Lampasa whom she lived with until she
died at the age of 85 way back in 1980s.During those times with her grandmother,
they would prepare snacks for her grandfather who was busy working in the farm and
has lots of fruits and vegetables planted around their land. Her grandmother would let
her assist in cooking and experimenting from whatever is available in the garden or on
the farm so as to offer food for the family during those times of hardship and low
income years.
Now that Rita has a family of her own, she continues on cooking a variety of native
delicacies like alupe, bandi, bukayo,atsara,peanut butter, salted and coated peanuts and
most especially this sinakol. She also sells vegetables fresh from their backyard
garden.
There are others who are making sinakol also but Rita prepares and cooks better than
any of them.","Learned from Rita's grandmother, the knowledge and skills is being passed on to her
youngest daughter,Enya Grace,13, who assists her in the making of this delicacy.","A native delicacy since the pre-Hispanic era, this sinakol evolved
through years and is still evolving yet the natural taste remains intact. There are new delicacies
being discovered around yet sinakol stood the test of time.

socially thus creating stronger bonds, camaraderie and affection. Building new friends and
acquaintances are also possible through orders coming from friends' recommendations and

once properly prepared and cooked. It has a high poison severity that can cause weak and
irregular breathing,weakness, excitement,depression,staggering,pupil dilation, spasms,
convulsions, and coma of short duration. The presence of cyanogenic glycosides linamarin and
lotaustralin cause this toxicity.","selling sinakol is one big help to the family in order to meet the
everyday demands of having sugar, milk and coffee on the table or the need for detergent
powder for laundry.",,,"The practice is going strong especially now that it is pandemic. The need to have money to
sustain the needs of the family and the need to eat something to nourish the body drive this
practice to thrive on.
As long as there is cassava supply, there is sinakol.","The health of the maker would be the main constraint for this practice to stop. At the age Of
48 she experiences heart palpitation and high blood pressure when overworked and stressed.
She has maintenance for all her health issues on the other hand.","1. By way of assisting, her family would surely master the art of cooking this delicacy.
2. By promoting the health benefits of a home cooked snack free from the chemicals of
preservatives and all that easy to prepare- one -shot snacks, the awareness to
preserve native delicacies and culinary heritage become more important.
3. By supporting locally made and home made products, the love for locals is being raised
up.","Rita and her family wake up early in the morning to grill the cassava roots to be cooked so that
this can be delivered on time to the buyers. Most of the time this early preparation is
advantageous to sell in the morning when no other sellers are on the streets thus getting more
customers.

Life is hard for the family that selling sinakol can at least help augment in the everyday needs
like sugar, milk and coffee.","assets/kakanin_images/puto_lanson.jpg"

source of livelihood and is surrounded with other neighboring barangays.
Sinapal making is also practiced by the neighboring barangay especially that of Gamad, Tobias
Fomier, Antique where Bangut Banwa is as well as some shamans and maaram are residing,","History

Pre-Spanish era, before colonizers came into the country, this practice was already
practiced especially by the siruwanos and the maarams. This is one basic ingredient when they
perform rituals like worship rites, initiation rites or shamanism and other related activities.
When somebody ask the maarams to bless their newly constructed house, school or other new
constructions, when there is a sayaw, when there is panguyang, and when it is closing time for
the Bangut Banwa rituals, sinapal is present among other panguyangs or offerings.","Rice (cooked)
Tapay (yeast, for fermentation)
Tuba (coconut wine, optional for added flavor)
Tabung leaves (used as wrappers for the mixture)","1. In making sinapal, a desired amount of rice is cooked the usual way like when
cooking rice for a meal.
2. Then it is transferred to a bowl, mixed with 'tapay' or yeast to be fermented for
24 hours or more depending on the maker. Other makers of sinapal add tuba or
coconut wine to this mixture to make it tastier.
3. After mixing thoroughly, a small or desired amount is scooped, placing it in
`tabung leaf, spreading neatly and flattening well into a square or rectangular
shape. Both ends of the leaf are folded to serve as wrapper. Fermentation
continues inside the folded leaf.
4. Same is done to the remaining mixture until a desired number, usually odd
number, is reached.
5. The wrapped mixture is stored in a closed container and allowed to ferment for
the next 24 hours keeping it undisturbed.
6. A liquor-like odor and taste is the smell after the yeast reacts with cooked rice.","As mentioned earlier, sinapal is being made by the maarams and siruwanos and are
used as part of their offerings in their rituals. Nobody makes sinapal for the sake of eating
them(which most are not familiar with the young generations) or any other purposes but by
the maarams.","The knowledge and skills are passed on from generation to generation of families with
inheritance of being maarams and siruwanos or albularyos.",,,,"A gathering of family and relatives because of the panguyang and daga,
ctreates a closer family ties. Sinapl can also be a way to introduce and teach the younger
generation the making of this. The children may be made aware that in other places in the
Philippines, this is one ordinary kakanin while for some a special and unique offering to
visitors of the place.","Besides puso (which is plain rice cooked inside a woven coconut
leaves), this is another mixture of cooked rice offered to the spirits during rituals done by
maarams.","The fermentation process acted upon by the presence of yeast
explains the smell and finished product of sinapal. The overnight soaking and sometimes
longer than that changed the cooked rice into something pungent but sweet combination of
starch and alcohol.","Once you are a family of maaram, you only are the ones who
make sinapal and other food preparations during rituals. The payment paid to the maaram is
one great help to their everyday living. This is one means of earning income.",,,"The practice continues as long as maarams are being consulted to do rituals they
oelleve are of big help to them. The making of sinapal can be learned and surely someone else
will learn this in the family of maarams.","The knowledge-bearers are in their golden years and the millennials are not so interested. If
there is no transfer of knowledge, this can be a threat.","As of this time, there are no known measures of safeguarding. There are still people in
the community and family that know this.","When Bangut Banwa hold its closing time rituals in the month of Lenten Season, one
thing they especially make is the sinapal, together with tuba the members of this organization
carefully put this inside the clay jars and on the second night after they immersed the sinapal,
with the tuba inside the jar, they sip the mixture using bagakay straw.

In rituals like panguyang and daga ka balay or sayaw sa kasal, this sinapla is eaten
after the rituals are done. Usually older people eat this because they are familiar with the smell
unlike the young generation who dislikes even just the smell.",

His purpose in cooking was not to sell the biko but to prepare it only for occasions, such as birthdays and fiestas. Everyone who has tasted his biko would always look for it and say that biko ni Oloy was delicious. When Mr. Oloy fell ill, his son Mr. Kim Russel Priestly L. Albania, replaced his father.

imitated her husband's biko.

Sometimes when they have occasions, the guests would look for the biko, then the moment she gives them ""bring-house"" (binalot), her guests would look at the cellophane bag to see if there is a piece of biko included. If they do not see a biko inside the bag, they will request for it.

Some of their relatives from other places like Davao and Bukidnon, will request and ask for biko ni Oloy to be sent via LBC Express (courier service). They also have relatives in Dubai that before travelling back, instead of packing bulad (sun-dried fish), they would prefer to bring biko. Their biko is also highly requested among politicians like Gov. Angging Quibranza Dimaporo, late Mayor Nene Noval, and Councilor Amay Samaniego, especially when there are conferences and events.

Due to their interest in making biko, they intend to make a fireplace used explicitly for their biko only. They also bought a large pan to accommodate a significant amount of biko.

even before the colonizers came to the Philippines.

It is usually prepared by Tubodnons during special holidays like Christmas, All Souls' Day, birthdays, fiesta, and even in a wake. As a matter of fact, one of its barangays adopted budbud as their official festival.

2 kgs Pilit (Glutinous rice)
8 pieces of Coconut fruit
1 kg white sugar
Salt
Milk (optional) Margarine(optional) Purple Rice
More or less 1.5 liters of water (for the extraction of coconut milk)
It also requires a banana leaf out of Cardava variety as a wrapper.
In cooking Budbud, there are specific measurements and ratios of the ingredients. In every
kilo of glutinous rice, you need to prepare 4 coconut fruits and its milk extract, a half kilo of white sugar, 1 tablespoon of salt, and a 1/16 purple rice. There is also an estimated
measurement of ingredients like the milk and the margarine.
On the other hand, this will help you expedite the cooking of budbud:
Note: Before lighting the fire, you need to soak the pilit first for about 2-3 hours and drained it well, cook the purple rice, and grate the coconut meat for its milk, prepare the banana leaf-pass it over the flame for about 15-20 seconds and cut it into 11 inches' sheet and trim
the stiff part of it.","These are the process of making special Budbud;
1. Start a fire.
2. Boil the extracted coconut milk. Put the Pandan leaf with it if ever there is.
3. Pour the glutinous rice and stir continuously. After a few minutes if the glutinous start becoming sticky, put the cooked purple rice until the whole mixture semi-dries up.
4. Pour the white sugar and stir again.
5. Stir continuously until it dries up (This whole process may take 25-35 minutes)
6. Take it out from the fire and transfer it to the basin or any container and let it cool.
7. Wrap it using a banana leaf. In doing it, you need to roll the leaves tightly, leave at least 1-1.5 inches of its end-to-end because you fold its edges to seal.
8. Cook it again for about 1 hour and a half for its finished product.

Mrs. Carnable learned this practice in her mid-30s because she used to help prepare it before. She owes her expertise to the acclaimed cooks of budbud in Tubaran, the late Mrs. Adelina Juntilla and Mrs. Antonina Alarin. These two happen to be considered as best makers of budbud kabog, a variety of budbud in Catmon, Cebu City. Through observation she was able to perfect the taste she wanted the most. In the 1980s, Mrs. Carnable started to cook budbud for their family gatherings. People then started to hire her to prepare the delicacy during the 1990s. Nowadays, people reach out to her and order the special budbud.

Her passion in cooking budbud was acquired by her two children, Felma and Frekent. Felma currently has a business named ""Yamby's Special Empanada"" where she offers Puto cheese, lumpia, and budbud. She started this business about 10 years ago.

Frekent Carnable, an Architecture student of Cebu Institute Technology, stated that whenever he falls short of his allowance or tuition fee, he cooks budbud and sells it there for Php 10.00 each, enough to cover up his financial needs.

processing steps was evaluated.","Dudol is definitely one of the rice-based delicacies that need consistent stirring. The thicker it
